Ionic-Firebase project from scratch

This project is just for learning Firebase with an IONIC 4 project with Angular as JS framework and using Capacitor instead of Cordova to communicate with the native layer of the phone.
Native parts we are going to use:
    - Statusbar 
    - Splash Screen (hiding it when our app is ready to run)
    - Camera
